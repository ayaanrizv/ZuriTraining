Artificial Intelligence in Action
In recent years, AI has made commendable progress. From the first independent shopping cart that delivers your food products to AI-generated music, AI is everywhere.

Globally, many organizations have started innovating a variety of tools and products that enhance business outcomes.

TCS ignio™ is one such innovative cognitive automation solution.

Digitate, a software venture of Tata Consultancy Services, won the Best Overall AI Company award from AI Breakthrough for 2019.

The following levels mark the rise of AI.

Narrow Intelligence
It applies to specific tasks, for example, Alexa, Sophia and Alpha Go.
General Intelligence
Machines are capable of imitating human intelligence.
Super Intelligence
At this level, machines can surpass humans.

Having had a glimpse of the evolution, you now know that AI has been here for more than half-a-century, so aren't you curious to find out why it is gaining importance now?

More Data
With social media coming into existence and with technology gaining momentum in all fields, data is getting generated at an n-measurable pace triggering the need for complex processing.

Accurate Algorithms
With data getting collected, now arises the need for algorithms that will perform accurate and quick computations.

More Computation Power
Much breakthrough has been made in the space of algorithms with the arrival of advanced machine and deep learning technologies. These algorithms mandate high computational power.

AI ---> ANI (narrow intelligence) eg - smart speaker, self-driving car etc.
---> AGI (general intelligence)

Data Science refers to the activity of analyzing a large amount of data to extract knowledge and insight leading to actionable decisions.

The main components in Data Science are, namely:

Acquiring
Cleaning
Describing
Exploratory Analysis
Making predictions
Suggesting recommendations

Acquiring Data

Acquire the raw data from a multitude of data sources, such as RDBMS and web pages.
Cleaning Data

Convert the raw data into a machine-readable format (enrich, detect/remove outliers, and apply business rules).
Describing Data

Summarize the data to get a holistic picture.
Exploratory Analysis

Explore and determine the patterns from the data. Visualize the data to unearth insights.
Making Predictions

Generalize the patterns in data to build models.

Make predictions on unknown data.

Suggesting Recommendations

Now you are good to suggest recommendations.

You have covered the components of Data Science in the previous cards.

To implement the same in an industry context, you need knowledge on few open standards such as CRISP-DM (Cross-industry standard process for data mining).

It has six phases, namely:

Business understanding
Data understanding
Data preparation
Modeling
Evaluation
Deployment

Algorithm

Algorithm is a set of rules and statistical techniques used to learn and derive insights from data patterns. e.g., Decision tree, Linear Regression, and Random Forest.

ML Model

ML model is a mathematical model trained by an algorithm to predict the patterns in the data.

Predictor Variable

Predictor variable is a variable used to predict another variable/output.

Response Variable

Response Variable is the target variable or the output variable that needs to be predicted.

Training Data

A model is built using training data.

Testing Data

Model is evaluated using testing data.

Predictor vs Response Variable

In the scenario where the height of the individual is predicted based on age, the predictor variable will be Age, and the response variable will be Height.

The following questions will aid you in defining a problem:

What kind of problem are you facing?
How much or how many? (Regression)
Which category? (Classification)
Which group? (Clustering)
Is this an outlier? (Anomaly detection)
Which option to opt? (Recommendation)
Once you have defined your problem, you need to strike the data science chord to get the data prepped up for further processing.

This is an example of Reinforcement Learning, which is defined as,

A part of Machine Learning where an agent is put in an environment where he learns to behave by performing actions that will either be rewarded or punished.

AlphaGo is Google's AI Reinforcement Learning example.

NLP - A machine’s ability to understand the human language by breaking it down, and then comprehend its meaning to determine the appropriate action, and respond in a language the user will understand.

Machine First™ Approach
Customer experience drives the digital world's business excellence. The omnipresence of digital technologies provides businesses and company leaders a myriad of options.
